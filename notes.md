**discretization:** breaking down a continuous object into segments (our case pixels)
**raster:** a xy grid; raster graphics, raster displays
**color quantization:** Matching the color with the closest color from the color palette that is available.
**banding:** continues gradients appear as a series of descrite steps or bands of color

**coplanar:** All points composing a face or polygon should lie on the same plane

**triangulation:** The process of converting faces into triangles
**sampling:** placing points or vertices along a smooth surface
**tessallation:** The process of converting a smooth surface to a triangle mesh

**ray tracing:** Ray tracing calculates the intersection of rays with scene geometry (geometric solution, algebraic solution)

**algebraic solution:** to the ray-object intersection test. This is feasible when the object's shape can be mathematically defined with an equation, typically representing a surface (implicit surfaces, e.g., a sphere's surface) across space.
